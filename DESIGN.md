# Design Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the key design decisions and architectural choices made in the Lead Form application. The application is designed to streamline the process of collecting and managing leads for visa consultation services.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Framework Choice: Next.js**
   - Server-side rendering capabilities for better SEO
   - Built-in API routes for backend functionality
   - File-system based routing
   - TypeScript support out of the box

2. **State Management: Redux Toolkit**
   - Centralized state management for leads and authentication
   - Async thunks for API calls
   - Predictable state updates
   - DevTools support for debugging

3. **Form Management: React Hook Form**
   - Performance-focused form validation
   - Minimal re-renders
   - Built-in validation and error handling
   - TypeScript support

4. **Styling: TailwindCSS**
   - Utility-first approach for rapid development
   - Consistent design system
   - Built-in responsive design
   - Zero runtime CSS-in-JS overhead

### Component Architecture

1. **LeadForm Component**
   - Controlled form inputs with validation
   - File upload handling
   - Country autocomplete with search
   - Visa type selection with multiple options
   - Success/error state handling

2. **LeadsList Component**
   - Table layout for lead management
   - Status management workflow
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Responsive design for mobile viewing

### Data Flow

```
User Input → Form Validation → API Request → Redux Store → UI Update
```

1. **Form Submission Flow**
   ```
   User fills form → Validation → POST /api/leads → Success Message
   ```

2. **Lead Management Flow**
   ```
   Admin views leads → Status update → PUT /api/leads → UI refresh
   ```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Status Management

We implemented a three-state lead status system:
- **PENDING**: Initial state for new leads
- **REACHED_OUT**: When initial contact is made
- **CLOSED**: When the lead process is complete

Rationale:
- Simple, clear status progression
- Matches typical lead workflow
- Easy to track and manage

### 2. Form Fields

Selected form fields based on essential visa consultation requirements:
- Personal information (name, email)
- Professional background (LinkedIn)
- Immigration specifics (visa interest, citizenship)
- Supporting documents (resume)

### 3. User Experience

Key UX decisions:
- Real-time form validation
- Autocomplete for country selection
- Clear status indicators
- Responsive design for all devices
- Immediate feedback on actions

### 4. Security Considerations

1. **Form Security**
   - Input validation
   - File type restrictions
   - Size limits on uploads

2. **API Security**
   - Authentication for admin routes
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration

## Future Improvements

1. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Implement proper database storage
   - Add cloud storage for files
   - Add email notifications
   - Implement user authentication

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Export leads to CSV
   - Bulk status updates
   - Comment system
   - Activity logging

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement pagination
   - Add caching
   - Optimize images
   - Add loading states

## Conclusion

The application is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly while meeting the core requirements of lead collection and management. The architecture allows for easy addition of new features and modifications to existing functionality.
